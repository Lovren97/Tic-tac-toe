# Tic-tac-toe

Fun and intresting project, I made during my free time in my second year of college. It's simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe with two different modes. Singleplayer, where you can play against computer and which difficulty you can also choose. Another game mode is Multiplayer mode, where you can play against another player.
